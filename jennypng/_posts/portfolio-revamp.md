> Documenting the thought process and learnings behind creating my current portfolio website, aka what you're looking at right now

## goals
I made my first portfolio website over winter break of freshman year (undergrad) to buff up my barren resume for an application to a robotics club.

but not enough to even comfortably describe my skill level as intermediate. That project was a bit rushed because I was working on it in a 
6 week build space - I wanted to use this portfolio revamp, something with no real deadline, as a chance to go slowly and really strengthen
my foundational knowledge.

## challenges
- **Project gallery**: I struggled a little with how to layout the project cards. I discovered that what I needed was a masonry layout. I attempted to use CSS grid,
as I read this was good for 2D layouts over flex, but it was a bit rigid - cards in the same row were forced to be the same height. I found a work-around
by changing grid to a column layout, but this meant the project content order was in the column direction rather than row (i.e. most recent projects are in
the first column and not the first row).
- **Animations**: I
