> Learnings from developing my first serious AR application over 8 weeks in a team of 4

## Project description
Multiplayer, co-located AR racing game allowing players in the same room to compete on custom, environment-aware, procedurally-generated racetracks.

## challenges

- Struggled with thinking of a capstone project idea - they expected something novel and technically complex in some way
    - we found it difficult to be original in the ar/vr space
    - the idea also needed to be feasible to implement an MVP in 8 weeks...
- After we decided the idea, there were so many unknowns as none of us had experience with procedural generation

## Research phase
- LLMs are very useful for gaining a broad overview of potential approaches
- Compiled a doc of seemingly relevant videos and tutorials
    - Compiled lots of videos specifically on procedurally generated roads - but these weren't AR/VR, or they were 2D, or not exactly what we were looking for
- mesh extrusion from splines
- 3D pathfinding
